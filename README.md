# React Beginner Project for Player Selection with API Fetch

This is a beginner project using React.js and will be helpful for beginner who are looking to get hold of the basic API call and basic state management.

I have implemented a budget limit and players can be removed from the selection list with the click of a button.

(NOTE: THE PROJECT IS NOT MOBILE/TABLET RESPONSIVE)
